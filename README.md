### If you don't use Windows...
This guide will focus on Windows, but you can find information for other OS's here:

# First, get scrcpy working over USB
1. Set up USB debugging for your device, and ensure you meet the other requirements: https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy#requirements
2. Plug your device into your computer. If USB debugging is set up correctly, it should prompt you to trust the computer.
2. Download the latest version, prebuilt for Windows: https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy#windows. Extract the folder.
3. Double click ````scrcpy.exe````. A cmd prompt window will open, then your phone screen should appear. Confirm you can operate your phone at this stage.


# The wireless method
1. Go to the ````Releases```` page (https://github.com/unassignedd/scrcpy-wirelessly/releases)
2. Download ````scrcpy-wireless.bat````
3. Place the file to the scrcpy directory
4. Run the batch file

Note: closing the cmd window closes your screen mirroring
